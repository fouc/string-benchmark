=====
Quick C/C++ String Benchmark.
=====

The third-party and cmake directories contains (awesome) work 
from Paul Hsieh, Maxim Yegorushkin and Joshua L. Blocher.

Requires:

- cmake
- Perl
- Python libraries
- Boehm Garbage Collector + Cord
- Qt4
- GNU time
- md5sum
- Data::Dumper

So, if you're feeling (very) lucky, you can:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make -j4
    $ cd ..
    $ perl benchmark.pl README --path=build --verbose > results.pm
